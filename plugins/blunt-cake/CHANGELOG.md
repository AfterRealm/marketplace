# Changelog

## v2.4.0 — 2026-04-10

> *Thin router, fat modes. SKILL.md lost 80% of its body weight without losing a single mode.*

### Changed — Progressive Disclosure Refactor
- **SKILL.md is now a thin router** (969 → 194 lines, 80% reduction)
- **8 mode files extracted to `modes/`** — loaded only when that mode is picked:
  - `modes/standard.md`, `modes/panel.md`, `modes/skill.md`, `modes/eval.md`
  - `modes/diff.md`, `modes/batter-battle.md`, `modes/roast-a-thon.md`, `modes/challenge.md`
- **Panel subagent prompts extracted** to `modes/panel-subagents/` — `security.md`, `performance.md`, `architecture.md`, `style.md`. Head Chef instructs each spawned specialist to read its own prompt file instead of inlining all 4 prompts (panel.md dropped from 105 → 61 lines as a result).
- **Custom Personality Creator extracted** to `personalities/custom.md` — loaded only when user picks Custom
- **Per-invocation context budget: ~72% smaller** (SKILL.md + 1 mode file ≈ 270 lines vs. 969 before)
- **Rules, Step 1, personality list, Auto-Fix, Roast Card all stay in SKILL.md** — they apply to every mode

### Why
Following Anthropic's recommended skill pattern: keep SKILL.md lean so the model can stay focused, especially on smaller models (Haiku). The 8 modes are mutually exclusive — loading all of them when the user picks one wastes context. Challenge mode alone was 165 lines that most roasts never touched. Now every mode only loads what it needs, and Panel mode's 4 subagent prompts only load when the Head Chef dispatches them.

### Eval Validation — Iteration 8
- 9 test cases, Opus reviewer + Opus judge
- **85% overall pass rate** — matches v2.1.0 baseline (86%) within noise
- **5/9 tests at 100%** — skill-roast, diff-roast, batter-battle, language-pack-snoop, auto-fix-offer
- **3/9 standard mode tests at 88-90%** — same as prior iterations
- Panel Roast 0% — known limitation (subagents can't spawn in `claude -p` headless, unchanged from prior versions)
- All quality metrics 4.4-4.6/5 — refactor introduces zero regression in output quality

### Fixed
- `scripts/update_check.py` `CURRENT_VERSION` bumped to 2.4.0 (was stuck on 2.2.2 since v2.3 releases — missed in prior bumps)
- `evals/run_eval.py` now composes the router + relevant mode file per test case (required by the new split — the old runner only inlined SKILL.md text, which would have broken every test under the new architecture)

### Personality Picker — Two-Stage Fix (UX bug)
- **Bug:** `AskUserQuestion` caps at 4 options per question. Blunt Cake has 6 built-in personalities + Custom = 7 options. The old picker showed Chef + 2 rotating + Custom = only 3 of 6 personalities visible per invocation, with the other 3 hidden behind the "Other" text input.
- **Fix:** Sequential two-stage personality picker. Mode and Personality fire as **separate sequential `AskUserQuestion` calls** — bundled calls render simultaneously and break the gateway pattern. Stage 1 always shows: Chef · Custom · 1 contextually relevant pick · 🎭 **More personalities** (gateway). If the user picks "More personalities", Stage 2 fires as a third sequential call with the 4 personalities that weren't in Stage 1.
- **Result:** Every personality reachable in ≤2 clicks. Custom is always 1 click. No personality is hidden.
- **Important:** The router explicitly forbids bundling Mode + Personality into one `AskUserQuestion` call. Bundled questions submit together and cannot conditionally fire Stage 2 based on Stage 1's answer.
- Found during interactive validation of the v2.4.0 refactor (Curb Cut skill roast with Simon Cowell — Meredith noticed only 3 personalities showed in the picker; second test caught the bundled-vs-sequential bug).

### Description Optimized per agentskills.io Guide
- **Old description** was descriptive ("Brutal but brilliant code reviewer with 8 modes...") and listed internal mechanics rather than user intent.
- **New description** follows the [agentskills.io optimizing-descriptions guide](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/optimizing-descriptions):
  - Imperative phrasing: "Use this skill when the user wants..."
  - Focuses on user intent (code review with personality, structured findings, fixes), not implementation details
  - Lists trigger categories pushy-style: roast/review/audit/check/judge requests, two-impl comparisons, git diffs, project grading, skill design meta-reviews
  - Explicit "even if the user doesn't say 'roast' or 'Blunt Cake'" pushiness
  - Explicit NOT clause: "Does NOT replace static analyzers, linters, formatters, or test runners" — prevents over-triggering
  - 746 chars, well under the 1024-char spec limit

### Description Optimization Loop — skill-creator systematic run
After applying the principles-based rewrite above, ran Anthropic's `skill-creator` Skill end-to-end optimization loop per the agentskills.io guide's full process — not just the principles section.

**Setup:**
- **20 trigger eval queries** designed by hand: 10 should-trigger (with realistic phrasing, varied detail, inline code so the model could actually invoke the test command), 10 should-not-trigger near-misses (prettier/refactor/accessibility/explain-regex/translate-language/library-lookup — all queries Claude could plausibly handle without reaching for blunt-cake)
- **60/40 train/test split** — train guides changes, held-out test catches overfitting
- **3 trials per query per iteration** for reliable trigger rates
- **5 iterations max** of: evaluate → propose improved description via Claude → re-evaluate
- **Best description selected by held-out test score**, not train score
- **4 parallel workers** (ThreadPoolExecutor) on Windows for ~4× speedup
- **Model:** claude-opus-4-6 (matches the model the user actually runs the skill against)

**Results (5 iterations, 11 minutes total wall-clock):**

| Iteration | Train accuracy | Train recall | Test accuracy | Test recall | Per-query test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (principles-based) | 53% | 6% | 50% | **0%** | 4/8 |
| **2 ⭐ winner** | **61%** | **22%** | **62%** | **25%** | **5/8** |
| 3 | 58% | 17% | 54% | 8% | 4/8 |
| 4 | 58% | 17% | 50% | 0% | 4/8 |
| 5 | 61% | 22% | 54% | 8% | 4/8 |

- **Precision was 100% across all iterations** — no description ever false-triggered on the should-not-trigger near-misses (prettier, refactor, accessibility, regex explain, language translation, library recs, test generation, debugging, logging, useEffect example). The polish-pass NOT clause holds firm.
- **The principles-based description's weakness was recall, not precision** — it caught 0% of the held-out should-trigger queries. The realistic test queries used implicit signals ("tear apart," "rip apart," "is this bad," "this is dogshit/trash," self-deprecating dumps) that the principles-based description didn't strongly match.
- **Iteration 2 fixed this** by enumerating aggressive synonyms and emotional signals: "brutal/savage/harsh/merciless feedback," "rip apart," "don't hold back," profanity-about-own-code, "should I push this," etc. This more than tripled the recall (0% → 25% on held-out) and added one full passing query to the test set (4/8 → 5/8).
- **Best selected by held-out test score** (62%, 5/8) — not train (61%, 6/12) — to avoid overfitting per the agentskills.io guide.

**Final description selected: iteration 2.** 960 chars (under the 1024-char spec limit). Replaces the principles-based description with the loop-optimized variant. The winning description is materially more pushy about catching synonyms and emotional signals while preserving the precision-protecting NOT clause.

**Honest caveats:**
- 5/8 on test isn't a great absolute score — it means the loop's best variant still misses ~75% of the should-trigger queries. That's a ceiling on what description-only optimization can do; the queries themselves are intentionally hard (realistic, casual, no explicit "roast" keyword). A perfect description would still struggle with queries like "does this regex suck" where the user's intent is implicit.
- The improvement is real (+12 points test accuracy, 0% → 25% recall) but modest in absolute terms.
- A future v2.4.1 could expand the eval set to ~50 queries and re-run for tighter signal — this run was the minimum viable optimization following the guide's recommended ~20-query design.

### Polish Pass — Final Review Findings
Five additional fixes from the pre-ship review of the v2.4.0 refactor:

1. **Step 1.5 added** — `Confirm There's Something to Roast`. Bridges the gap between personality selection and mode-file load: if no file/code/diff was provided in the trigger, the router asks for it before proceeding. Mode-specific exceptions documented (Roast Challenge skips it; Skill Roast searches for the SKILL.md file).
2. **Batter Battle contextual personality mapping added** — was previously absent from the contextual pick list, falling through to the Simon Cowell default by accident. Now explicit: `Batter Battle / head-to-head → 🎤 Simon Cowell (judge-panel vibe)`.
3. **Markdown menu vs AskUserQuestion guidance** — added one-line clarification at the top of the AskUserQuestion section: the chat-style markdown menu in Step 1 is the fallback for non-interactive contexts (headless `claude -p`, CI), while AskUserQuestion is the primary interface for interactive sessions.
4. **Panel mode merge logic clarified** — `modes/panel.md` Step 2 now defines what counts as cross-confirmed: same line range OR same root cause in different words. "When in doubt, treat as separate" rule added (false splits are easier to clean up than false merges). Cross-confirmed findings get a `[CROSS-CONFIRMED ×N]` badge in the output.
5. **Roast Card version placeholder** — `v2.4` hardcode replaced with `{VERSION}` placeholder. Rule #7 added to Roast Card Rules: read the version from SKILL.md frontmatter at runtime, don't hardcode. Eliminates manual version-bump-stale risk for the card footer.

### No Behavior Changes
All 8 modes, all 6 personalities, all rules, all output formats are identical. This is a pure architectural refactor — every roast produces the same result as v2.3.1 with less context burned. The personality picker fix and the polish pass are UX improvements, not behavior changes — the same personalities exist with the same voices, the same findings get reported with the same severities.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-04-05

> *Four modes. Because one way to judge your code was never enough.*

### Eval Mode (Professional Grade)
- Serious code analysis with scored assertions — no jokes until the final verdict
- Generates 8-12 testable assertions per file across 5 categories: Correctness, Security, Reliability, Performance, Maintainability
- Each assertion graded PASS/FAIL with specific evidence (line numbers, code quotes)
- 5 quality dimension scores (1-5) with one-line justifications
- Letter grade (A-F) with pass rate and overall score
- Critical findings get detailed fixes in serious tone
- Final verdict delivered with roast energy — the payoff

### Interactive Mode Selection
- Skill now asks which mode on trigger: Standard 🔥 / Panel 👨‍🍳 / Skill Roast 🎯 / Eval 📊
- Skips the question if user already specified mode in their trigger
- Clear descriptions for each mode so users know what they're getting

### Self-Roast Fixes (from running Skill Roast on ourselves)
- Trigger priority order formalized (Skill → Panel → Standard → Eval)
- Panel agent prompts expanded from one-liners to full specs with severity scales, JSON schemas, and line number requirements
- Edge case handling added (trivially simple code gets a short roast, not manufactured issues)
- Skill Roast output format fully specified (was inheriting code format)
- Rules section moved to top of SKILL.md (behavioral constraints read first)
